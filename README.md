LongPressButtonAnimationDemo
============================

Similar to the Snapchat video recording button animation, this shows how to run an animation when you hold a button down and cancel it when you let go.  It also runs a method if you hold the button for a set amount of time.

use this for whatever you like, you should be able to take the MKButtonAnimationTutorial.h and .m files,
throw them in and link up the variables and it should work.
